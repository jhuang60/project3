    <h1>Hello...</h1>
    <p id="maintext">
      My name is Jia Yu Huang. I'm currently a second year student
      in Illinois Institute of technology majoring in Information Technology
      and Management. I was born in China but in a young age, my family moved
      from China to Mexico and then later on to Chicago. Attending a technical school
      was something that I never thought myself doing. Growing up, I always thought that I
      will one day go to an art school. My decision of coming to IIT was made during
      my senior year of high school when I was exposed to more programming and competitions.
